        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="assets/images/photo-dirk-mug.jpg" class="auth-image img-responsive pull-left" alt="Dirk Wiggins" width="200">
        <p>As a child I was offered so many opportunities, I did not even recognize them as such. I was afforded the ability to fail, and did so, over and over again. In my late twenties I found coding, and started to develop success. Building code also helped me to build power, and altered the way in which I interact with our world and within my community. I know now that opportunity is far more rare and special than I understood as a child. I have spent the last 7 years of my professional life understanding the challenges faced by underrepresented communities in the technology development space and working to recreate the kind of opportunities I was given.</p>

        <p>In my extended college years, I studied philosophy, religion, astronomy, physics, and engineering. But it was my childhood exposure to computer programming from which I forged a career. That skill, latent for over a decade, awoke and gave me power and opened opportunities.</p>
        
        <p>The skills I learned running programs on our Apple IIe as a child led to further chances to grow, learn, and connect. I got to work with the top scientists in their respective fields, devising cutting edge solutions at Lawrence Berkley National Lab. I had the privilege to leave that dream job to seek another; creating my own technology and developing an online platform to connect employees with training.</p>
        
        <p>Programming skills have placed me in the decision-making team within every organization with which I have worked. I skipped the years of paying dues in every industry - from healthcare to education, and technology to politics - and had the opportunity to see my work directly and immediately impact the mission.</p>
        
        <p>By 2012, when a company I helped to form was sold, those skills had also given me financial power. It was then that I started Code for Progress, an organization designed to assist others in building the same types of power I found in coding. I designed that program to address some of the imbalance in opportunity, and help individuals build power for themselves and within their communities.</p>
        
        <p>I have had many successes, and a good deal more challenges in the 5 years I've run Code for Progress, but the experience and understanding I've gained, I consider some of my most valuable assets. I am now eager to place the full body of that experience, all of my energy, and my hopeful spirit into bringing the program to Philadelphia.</p>
        
        <p>Code for Progress Philadelphia's intent to provide exposure, guidance, and a runway clear of obstacles - will help to supply some of the elements necessary to build opportunity. It is clear that where these elements come together, power is built.</p>
